# Why These Transactions Should Be Flagged as Anomalies

## Transaction Analysis

### Transaction 1: Card Insertion with No Clear Outcome
```
[020t15706/18/202513:39
TRANSACTION START
[020t CARD INSERTED
[020t 13:39:56 CARD TAKEN
[000p[040q(I 75561D(10,M-090B0210B9,R-4S
[000p[040q(I 75561D(10,M-00,R-4S
[020t 13:39:56 TRANSACTION END
[020t15806/18/202513:39
PRIMARY CARD READER ACTIVATED
```

**Anomaly Indicators:**
- ⚠️ **No dispense success message**
- ⚠️ **Card taken immediately** (same minute as insertion)
- ⚠️ **Cryptic codes** `[000p[040q(I 75561D(10,M-090B0210B9,R-4S`
- ⚠️ **No clear transaction completion**
- ⚠️ **Customer received nothing** but card was returned

### Transaction 2: PIN Entry with No Successful Outcome
```
[020t*209*06/18/2025*14:23*
      *TRANSACTION START*
 [020t CARD INSERTED
  14:23:03 ATR RECEIVED T=0
 [020t 14:23:06 OPCODE = FI      
   PAN 0004263********6687
   ---START OF TRANSACTION---
 [020t 14:23:22 PIN ENTERED
 [020t 14:23:36 OPCODE = BC      
   PAN 0004263********6687
   ---START OF TRANSACTION---
 [020t 14:24:28 CARD TAKEN
 [020t 14:24:29 TRANSACTION END
```

**Anomaly Indicators:**
- ⚠️ **PIN entered but no successful transaction**
- ⚠️ **No dispense or withdrawal indication**
- ⚠️ **Customer waited over 1 minute** (14:23 to 14:24)
- ⚠️ **Two "START OF TRANSACTION" messages** (possible system confusion)
- ⚠️ **Customer expectation vs. reality mismatch**

## Why These Are Critical Anomalies

### 1. Customer Impact
- **Customer inserted card and entered PIN** → expects transaction
- **No money dispensed** → frustrated customer
- **No clear error message** → customer doesn't know what happened
- **These are service failures** from customer perspective

### 2. Business Impact
- **Lost revenue** (customer couldn't complete transaction)
- **Customer dissatisfaction** (poor experience)
- **Operational issues** (ATM not functioning properly)
- **Potential hardware problems** (cryptic codes suggest issues)

### 3. Technical Indicators
- **Incomplete transaction flows**
- **System error codes** (cryptic messages)
- **Timing anomalies** (too quick or too slow)
- **Missing success confirmations**

## Root Cause: ML Model Training Issues

### Current ML Model Problems

1. **Training Data Bias**
   - Model likely trained on "obvious" anomalies (device errors, supervisor mode)
   - **Not trained on "incomplete transaction" patterns**
   - Missing patterns for customer-impacting issues

2. **Feature Engineering Issues**
   - May focus on specific error keywords
   - **Not considering transaction flow completeness**
   - Missing temporal patterns (timing analysis)

3. **Anomaly Definition Problems**
   - System looking for "technical errors"
   - **Not considering "customer experience failures"**
   - Missing business-context anomalies

## Fixes Required

### 1. Enhance Training Data
```python
# Add these patterns to training data
incomplete_transaction_patterns = [
    "CARD INSERTED + CARD TAKEN + NO DISPENSE",
    "PIN ENTERED + NO SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME",
    "TRANSACTION START + TRANSACTION END + NO COMPLETION",
    "CRYPTIC CODES + NO CLEAR RESOLUTION"
]
```

### 2. Improve Feature Engineering
```python
# Add transaction flow analysis
def analyze_transaction_flow(session_logs):
    has_card_insertion = 'CARD INSERTED' in session_logs
    has_pin_entry = 'PIN ENTERED' in session_logs
    has_dispense_success = 'DISPENSE SUCCESS' in session_logs
    has_withdrawal = 'WITHDRAWAL' in session_logs
    
    # Flag as anomaly if customer interaction without success
    if (has_card_insertion or has_pin_entry) and not (has_dispense_success or has_withdrawal):
        return True, "customer_interaction_no_success"
    
    return False, "normal"
```

### 3. Add Business Context Rules
```python
# Add expert rules for customer-impacting anomalies
customer_impact_rules = {
    'incomplete_transaction': {
        'pattern': r'CARD INSERTED.*CARD TAKEN.*(?!.*DISPENSE SUCCESS)',
        'severity': 'HIGH',
        'reason': 'Customer inserted card but received no service'
    },
    'pin_no_result': {
        'pattern': r'PIN ENTERED.*(?!.*DISPENSE SUCCESS|WITHDRAWAL)',
        'severity': 'HIGH', 
        'reason': 'Customer entered PIN but transaction failed'
    }
}
```

### 4. Retrain Model with Your 66 Labeled Examples
- **Your 66 labeled anomalies** likely include similar patterns
- **The retraining we fixed** should now use these examples
- **Model should learn** from your expert labeling

## Immediate Actions

1. **Apply the database and dependency fixes** (already done)
2. **Trigger retraining** with your 66 labeled examples
3. **Add specific rules** for incomplete transactions
4. **Test with these specific transactions**

## Expected Improvements

After retraining with your labeled data:
- ✅ **Incomplete transactions** should be flagged
- ✅ **PIN entry with no result** should be flagged  
- ✅ **Customer service failures** should be detected
- ✅ **Business-impacting issues** should be prioritized

The key insight is that **your ML model needs to understand customer experience**, not just technical errors. These transactions represent **service failures** that directly impact customers and business operations.
