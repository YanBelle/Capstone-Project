# API Module and Model Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **API Service Missing ML Analyzer Module**
   - Error: `No module named 'ml_analyzer'`
   - Cause: API service trying to import a module only present in the anomaly-detector service
   - Fix: Copy ml_analyzer.py and dependencies to the API service directory

2. **Model Loading Error**
   - Error: `Error loading models: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/app/models/scaler.pkl'`
   - Cause: System trying to load models that don't exist yet
   - Fix: Improved error handling in model loading function to gracefully handle missing models

## Solution Components

### 1. File Copy Script
Copied necessary files from anomaly-detector to API service:
- `ml_analyzer.py` - Core anomaly detection logic
- `simple_embeddings.py` - Supporting module for embeddings

### 2. Model Directory Initialization
Created directories and placeholder files:
- Created `/app/models` directory
- Added default `expert_rules.json`
- Modified code to handle missing model files gracefully

### 3. Docker Configuration Updates
Ensured both services share the same model volume:
- Both services now mount `./data/models:/app/models`
- Directory structure is consistent across services

## How to Apply the Fix

Run the provided `complete_fix.sh` script:

```bash
chmod +x complete_fix.sh
./complete_fix.sh
```

Then rebuild and restart the services:

```bash
docker-compose build api anomaly-detector
docker-compose up -d
```

## Validation

After applying the fix:
1. Check the logs of both services to ensure no errors: `docker-compose logs -f api anomaly-detector`
2. Trigger retraining from the dashboard - it should now work without errors
3. The models will be trained on the first batch of data processed

## Additional Notes

- The system is now more resilient to missing models and will properly initialize on first run
- Both services (API and anomaly-detector) can now independently operate with the ML analyzer module
- Retraining functionality in the API service should work correctly

This fix allows the continuous learning feature to work properly, enabling the system to adapt to new anomaly patterns over time.
