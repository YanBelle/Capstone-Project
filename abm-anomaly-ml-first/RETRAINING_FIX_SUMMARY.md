# Retraining System Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The retraining system was not working because:
1. The `get_continuous_learning_status()` method only checked the in-memory `feedback_buffer`
2. Your 66 labeled anomalies were stored in the database but not loaded into the feedback buffer
3. The retraining process required 5+ feedback samples but found 0 since it wasn't checking the database

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified MLFirstAnomalyDetector Constructor
- Added `db_engine` parameter to accept database connection
- File: `services/anomaly-detector/ml_analyzer.py`

### 2. Updated get_continuous_learning_status() Method
- Now checks both in-memory feedback buffer AND database labeled_anomalies table
- Returns combined count as `feedback_buffer_size`
- Added separate counters for debugging: `feedback_buffer_memory` and `feedback_database_count`

### 3. Added load_labeled_anomalies_from_database() Method
- Loads all labeled anomalies from database into feedback buffer
- Converts database format to feedback buffer format
- Handles different label types (anomaly/normal) appropriately

### 4. Updated continuous_model_retraining() Method
- Now calls `load_labeled_anomalies_from_database()` first
- Reduced minimum feedback threshold from 10 to 5 samples
- Will now use your 66 labeled anomalies for retraining

### 5. Updated Service Instantiation
- Modified `services/anomaly-detector/main.py` to pass database connection
- Modified `services/api/main.py` to pass database connection

## Expected Behavior Now
1. When you click the retraining button, it will:
   - Load your 66 labeled anomalies from the database
   - Add them to the feedback buffer
   - Proceed with retraining since 66 > 5 samples
   - Actually retrain the models with your labeled data

2. The continuous learning status endpoint will now show:
   - `feedback_buffer_size`: 66 (total count)
   - `feedback_database_count`: 66 (from database)
   - `feedback_buffer_memory`: 0 (in-memory buffer)

## Next Steps
1. Rebuild the Docker services: `docker compose build`
2. Restart the services: `docker compose up -d`
3. Test the retraining button - it should now work with your labeled data
4. Check the logs to see retraining progress

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Check continuous learning status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/continuous-learning/status

# Trigger retraining
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/continuous-learning/trigger-retraining

# Check logs
docker compose logs api
docker compose logs anomaly-detector
```

The key fix was connecting the database-stored labeled anomalies to the retraining process, which wasn't happening before.
