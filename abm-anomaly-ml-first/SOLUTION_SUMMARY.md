# Knowledge-Guided ML Enhancement Solution

## Problem Analysis

Your current ML-first ABM anomaly detection system has rigid expert override rules that are interfering with ML learning by:

1. **Completely blocking ML predictions** for certain patterns
2. **Preventing pattern discovery** - ML can't learn variations of known patterns
3. **Using binary decisions** instead of confidence weighting
4. **Not leveraging known error patterns** as positive training signals

## Solution Overview

I've created a **Knowledge-Guided ML Enhancement** that replaces rigid expert overrides with intelligent confidence adjustment while preserving ML learning capabilities.

### Key Innovation: Confidence Adjustment Instead of Override

**Before (Problematic)**:
```python
# OLD: Binary override - kills ML learning
if self.is_successful_withdrawal(session):
    session.is_anomaly = False      # ❌ Complete override
    session.anomaly_score = 0.0     # ❌ Lost ML insights
    return True                     # ❌ No learning signal
```

**After (Enhanced)**:
```python
# NEW: Confidence adjustment - preserves ML learning
adjustment = self.confidence_adjuster.adjust_ml_confidence(session, ml_score)
session.ml_anomaly_score = ml_score                    # ✅ Preserve original ML
session.knowledge_adjusted_score = adjustment['score'] # ✅ Apply domain knowledge
session.anomaly_score = adjustment['score']            # ✅ Final balanced score
# ML can still learn from the original signal!
```

## How It Solves Your Problems

### Problem 1: Rigid Rules Interfering with ML
**Solution**: Confidence adjustment preserves ML learning while applying domain knowledge
- Known normal patterns: Reduce confidence to 15-20% (not 0%)
- Known error patterns: Boost confidence by 30-50%
- ML always gets to see the original signal for learning

### Problem 2: Cannot Build on Known Patterns
**Solution**: Pattern similarity analysis finds variations
```python
# System can now detect:
# Base pattern: "NOTES PRESENTED" → "NOTES TAKEN" 
# Variations: "NOTES PRESENTED" → "TIMEOUT" → "NOTES TAKEN"
#            "NOTES PRESENTED" → "USER_CANCELED"
#            "NOTES PRESENTED" → "RECEIPT_PRINTED" → "NOTES TAKEN"
```

### Problem 3: Not Leveraging Data Science Models
**Solution**: Integration with advanced log analysis models
- **Temporal Analysis**: Detect timing anomalies using time series models
- **Sequence Analysis**: LSTM models for transaction flow anomalies  
- **Semantic Analysis**: NLP models for contextual understanding
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple detection approaches
